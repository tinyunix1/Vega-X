Hello! 

If you are confused on how to get started with exploiting, or how to execute scripts, 
please watch this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0OKDV2HeYwc

(Even though it's with the old version of Vega X, the tutorial still mostly works)

If you need any further help, go to www.vegax.gg and join my discord support server!




*IMPORTANT!*

The autoexecute, workspace, and scripts folders will appear once you open the executor.


If you want to add your own scripts to the vega x menu, make a notepad file and drop it into the "ADD_SCRIPTS_HERE" Folder!
